A charmer who's much nicer than he is kind, Jay Spector is easy to love, but hard to like.

He is able to manipulate metal and alloys in multiple, nuanced ways: ranging from superficial ones, like altering the shape, curvature, and thickness, to more complex ones, such as welding and separating pieces of metal, and adjusting tensile strength. Physical contact is not necessary; however, the larger the object he is trying to control, the closer he must be in terms of distance. Sparks of his misaligned aura cause accidental effects instead, due to his inexperience—at times, most of the time, unwantedly explosive.

reputation: `[ORIGIN]
The family name is attached to a notable line of inventors, metalworkers, and polymaths, dating all the way back to Hylia's time—figures that have gravitated and focused on providing the foundational practices and materials for Hunters, whilst occasionally dipping into the field. An innate thirst for knowledge is said to be etched into their very blood. 

The latest, however, is said to have been a complete and utter fraud. It's no secret at all: Andreas Stavrou was recently charged with a pile of criminal offences, and effectively stripped of his former title and career as a result. It, fortunately or unfortunately, only made fourth page news.

This has left Xenophon as the sole descendant to the entire name.

[ACADEMY]
A transfer student, after the wave of transfer students, after that wave of transfer students. Following a string of attending various educational institutions, he's ended up at Voxenfelle Academy's doorstep. He is, by mannerism and reputation, the eternal, perpetual ""new boy at school"".

At first glance, Xenophon comes off as someone awkward, indifferent, and possibly self-absorbed. Unabashedly blunt, he follows a direct line of communication with all matters that come to his table. He is upfront, while simultaneously being unimaginably difficult to read: with a constant stiff edge to his neutral expression that'd make anyone wonder ""does that guy ever feel happy?"". Studious, but in all the wrong places. Easy to misunderstand. Inclination for short answers. But when you get him talking...

The background murmur and prevailing rumour is that he's been expelled from almost each and every single school preceding this one.
