        <div className='news-title'>BREAKING: NIKOLA YUNGE INTRODUCES NEW BILL, ALL VOIDPACTS TO BE TERMINATED. SENATE VOTING SOON.</div>

        <div className="news-body">
            <p>On October 21st, Minister of Defense Nikola Yunge introduced a private bill to the Astralena House of Parliament. Bill A-284 entails an immediate outlawing of voidpacted peoples and the termination of all active voidpacts across the country. The 3rd reading of the bill has since been passed with a majority assent vote in the House of Representatives and has been sent onto the senate for further voting and discussion.</p>
            <p>Despite a large amount of the public being for the existence of voidpacted people within Astralena, Yunge has consistently been a voice against the integration of voidpacted peoples. Voices of dissent against this bill claim there is a severe lack of diversity in representatives within the Parliament and Senate. There are claims that a high concentration of anti-voidpact politicians sitting in parliament is severely limiting social progress within Astralena and is preventing our potential growth and advancements as a country.</p>
            <p>The major lack of dissenting voices within parliament has been raising concerns on social media. Notably, Rowan S. Sullivan, has been absent from both the second reading as well as the third and has been under fire from activists online due to said absence. Sources say Sullivan had been banned from joining the debate for the bill due an investigation by the police launched prior to the date. Insiders claim said investigation was filed via Yunge just before the debate for the bill. There are suspicions on whether the timing of the report was made to overlap with the passing of the bill on purpose, however the absence of Sullivan throughout the process seems to have had a significant impact on the outcome of the bill.</p>
            <p>This new bill comes as horrible news not only for voidpacted at Voxenfelle, but all across the country. The future for our voidpacted classmates are still in the air as this bill continues to develop. Student groups and voidpact activists in Astralena are currently organizing protests to try and prevent this bill from getting passed. No word has appeared as of yet on any calls to action or dates of protest.</p>
            <p>Currently, Bill A-284 has passed the House of Representatives and is being sent to the senate for the first reading. The date for the first reading has yet to be announced. Felle-Press will continue to watch for updates on the bill.</p>
