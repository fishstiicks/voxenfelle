        <div className='news-title'>THE FELLE-FESTIVAL TOURNAMENT:  A BRIEF REVIEW</div>
        <div className='news-author'>by Halynn</div>

        <div className="news-body">
            <p>The Felle-Festival is a longtime Voxenfelle tradition where students contest against each other to test their strength and flex their skills. The tournament has had an impressive history even before it was open to the public, with numerous iconic champions and incredible displays of aura in ways previously unthinkable. Today we’ll be discussing some of the most iconic wins of the tourney.</p>
            <p>One of the most awe-inspiring wins in the history of the tournament is that of Ruka Katsia. During the 42nd year of the school’s opening, the legendary hunter Ruka Katsia won with the expert usage of his shadow aura. It was previously known to be impossible for a shadow aura user to be so powerful, but with his sharp athletic sense and clever thinking he was able to rise as the champion of that year.</p>
            <p>Another iconic win that took place in the school’s 116th year was by ice aura hunter Elysia Young. With a breathtaking display of ice aura, she swept the competition in one blow. Her impressive capacity for area wide ice attacks granted her the moniker of Ice Queen that year.</p>
            <p>Among the iconic champions throughout the history of the event, there were a few controversial wins. The most notable being a recent result in the school’s 130th year, by a student that hadn’t manifested their aura yet. While late bloomers aren’t super uncommon among aura users, it’s a widely known fact that the chance of developing an aura exponentially decreases as a person increases in age. This win was deemed controversial due to the fact that it was won by a final year student. This particular student, despite being the top of their grade, hadn’t developed an aura all throughout their time at the school. Winning the tournament as a non-aura user was an impressive feat, but one that raised questions regardless, especially due to rumors saying the student was only admitted due to familial ties with a faculty member.</p>
            <p>It was after this specific incident that the Fellfest organizers added a new criteria to the tournament. While the tournament was previously in the style of a solo battle royale, the new rule stated that one must participate in soulbound pairs, thus ensuring that all competitors are of equal standing.</p>
            <p>The Felle-Festival tournament has many more iconic wins and inspiring champions that weren’t covered in this article. I would recommend reading the Felle-Festival timeline on the Voxenfelle homepage for an expanded summary that briefly touches on all the champions that decorate the hall of fame. For those interested in more in-depth material I would recommend the text “Fellfest: A History of Excellence” by Theodore Belanger; it's available in hardcover or ebook form in the Voxenfelle library or any bookstore in Astralena.</p>
