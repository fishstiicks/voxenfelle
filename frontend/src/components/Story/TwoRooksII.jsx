                <p>Viktoriya steps away from the attack. In one quick motion, she hits the back of Rin's neck with her cane. A loud thump echoes through the air.</p>
                <p>Rin collapses to the ground, unconscious.</p>
                <p>"..."</p>
                <p>The sound of static crackles. Viktoriya puts a hand to her ear, as if listening to something.</p>
                <p className='small'>"Yes, understood."</p>
                <p>Mismatched eyes settle on the scene, glancing over you one by one. Viktoriya straightens her posture, her cane tapped loudly to the ground.</p>
                <p>"...Voxenfelle Academy."</p>

            <p>The clock ticks.</p>
            <p>In front of youâ€”in the fleshâ€”is Viktoriya Yunge, daughter of the Defense Minister.</p>
            <p>Something cold washes over you in her presence. It's a different feeling from Cain; while he was obviously dangerous, it was always a gamble with himâ€”a man who was in it for the thrill of the game and nothing else.</p>
            <p>But Viktoriya was a different story. You can feel it in your bones.</p>
            <p>This was Nikola Yunge's guard dog. The ace up his sleeve, the shadow trailing behind him, the last chess piece on the board,</p>
            <p>And the one who'll turn the tide in his favour.</p>
