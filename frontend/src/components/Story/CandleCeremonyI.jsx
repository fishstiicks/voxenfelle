            <p>The sun begins to sleep over the city of Hysse.</p>
            <p>Today marks the last day of Void's Eve. After a week of festivities, only one event yet remains to mark the holiday's end: the Candle Ceremony.</p>
            <p>Festival booths close up shop one after another as tenants and visitors alike leave in preparation. Though a portion of the attendees have gone ahead to the Hysse river, some remain here to finish up their letters and add finishing touches to their lanterns. The lantern station, albeit more or less empty, has left out some blank lanterns and paint for any last-minute attendees who haven't gotten to prepare yet. </p>
            <p>There's still some time left until the ceremony starts. Have you gotten your lanterns in order? Who will be in your thoughts tonight? Are you writing to anyone at all?</p>
            <p>Regardless of your participation, melancholy seems to hang quietly in the air. </p>
            <p>You feel the night will be a long one.</p>

                <p>Just as Vinca's about to lead you all to the river...</p>
                <p>Realization dawns on him as he rummages through his pockets for something non-existent. "Oh, gosh, I forgot my letter back at the office."</p>
                <p>"Um... I'll leave Professor Strega to chaperone you all to the river. I'll be back in a second, alright! I just need to write a new one." Glancing over his peer who is probably a stone's throw away.</p>
                <p>He runs off somewhere to the side.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Eventually, you make your way over to the Hysse river.</p>
        <p>Although crowds have gathered along the riverbank, with Yuenris guiding you along, you manage to find a spot somewhere amongst the crowded sea of people.</p>
        <p>You spot an elderly woman carrying three small lanterns in her arms. The lanterns have been painted carefully with intricate weave patterns. Though they're painted with different designs, they seem to share some motifs with each other, as if they were all family.</p>
        <p>You spot a few children, huddled around a large lantern that nearly rivals them in size. A myriad of things have been painted onto the lantern's surface: suns, stars, flowers, butterflies, candy… you even spot a few handprints here and there.</p>
        <p>You spot a young adult, carrying two medium-sized lanterns in one hand. Though the lanterns are in opposite colours, they seem to be painted with the exact same floral design, as if mirroring each other.</p>

            <p>A lone girl sits on a bench, wiping warm tears from her eyes.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Chou-chou kneads her cheeks, rubbing away tear marks as she tries to calm herself down. Though it was the last day of Void's Eve, she could hardly enjoy the atmosphere—much less join the Candle Ceremony.</p>
            <p>Her shoulders droop at the thought. Truthfully, she had looked forward to joining the event with everyone else. But with how things were between her and Oma (and Pomme, too), it was difficult to muster any will to walk towards the riverbank.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>As she mulls the thought over, her hand absentmindedly reaches for her phone.</p>
            <p>It unlocks easily with a few swipes. Chou-chou checks her inbox, noticing a few unopened messages. She sends a quick reply to one of the few people she's willing to talk to right now—Rin—but the message doesn't send.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>She swipes the app closed and checks her social media instead. She scrolls, and scrolls, and scrolls, and…</p>

            <p>Chou-chou sits up straight, eyebrows scrunching as she scans over her phone screen.</p>

                </div>

                </div>

            <p>Panic starts to wash over her face. She searches a website and reads.</p>

            <p>Silence starts to fall. It's almost time.</p>
            <p>One by one, folded letters find their way to lit flames, unsaid words slowly turning to ash and scattering in the evening wind.</p>
            <p>Your hopes, dreams, love, and regrets—it's time to burn them all away, and hope that they reach those who have passed. Release your lanterns. Watch them fly as they return to Hylia once more.</p>

            <p>You watch as your lantern floats into the air.</p>

            <p>Soon, another lantern joins its place in the sky, followed by another, and another, and another. And before you know it, the night sky has all but filled with lanterns, creating a sea of lights—and souls—overhead. Though the sight fills you with serenity, a sense of melancholy also blooms deep within your chest as you watch them float away.</p>

            <br></br>
            <p>pray, for the souls who have gone before us,</p>
            <p>pray, for the ones who are still with us,</p>

            <br></br>
            <p>For tonight, Hylia watches over us all.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Somehow, you feel as if Hylia herself is listening to your prayers.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Whether you pray or not, the sound of something shooting into the air catches your attention. You tilt your head up to the sky, when suddenly you see—</p>

            <p>Fireworks, shattering into thousands of glittering sparks above you.</p>
            <img className='story-cg' src="https://i.ibb.co/m5CZrLy/Illustration25-1.png"></img>
            <p>They whizz and coil upwards, bursting in quick succession, creating a kaleidoscope of colours behind gently floating lanterns.</p>
            <p>You feel your heart stirring at the sight.</p>

                <p>"Pomme, Oma—hah, we need, we need to—" Her words stagger as she struggles to catch her breath, but although her words come out in broken fragments, the sense of urgency in her voice is palpable.</p>

            <p>You look around. It's difficult to move your attention elsewhere—your eyes keep returning to Chou-chou panicking in front of you.</p>
            <p>Footsteps grow louder by the second, heavy as it cuts through the air.</p>
            <p>All of a sudden, you find yourselves surrounded.</p>

            <p>Policemen stand before the crowd of students, forming a half-circle as they block any possible exits from the river. Each one of them stares you down with a steely gaze.</p>
            <p>…Eventually, you notice the patrol rifles in their arms.</p>

            <p>One by one, they raise their rifles in quick succession.</p>
            <p>All of them are pointed at you.</p>
            <p>Your vision darts between the policemen, eyeing for a way out. But their formation is tight—escape seems impossible. As you catch sight of their weapons, you notice something.</p>
            <p>…They're only aiming at voidpacts.</p>

            <p>Rin's shouting follows quickly after.</p>

            <p>You see her—Yuenris—fallen to the ground, a hand raised to clutch at the side of her head. Despite the slight distance, you're able to catch sight of something dripping onto the ground.</p>

            <p style={{color: '#ad1b1b' }}>Blood.</p>

            <p>It trickles down her face, down her chin, before freefalling down to the ground. The red liquid soaks into the earth, disappearing as if it never existed in the first place.</p>
            <p>The police officer clicks his tongue.</p>
            <p>He raises his gaze—his expression a mix of anger and annoyance—and settles his eyes on the lot of you.</p>
