        <div className="story-body">
            <p>You arrive thirty minutes before morning prayer commences, at the first stroke of sunrise. No one's curious gaze lingers for very long, as they're a little too busy going around, getting preparations in order. Priests and priestesses flow around the fountains and sculptures, neat and orderly as they guide people to their places. It smells coastal and breezy, fresh as new beginnings. At all four corners of the walkway that leads up to the figure of the goddess, light weaves patterns across the pools of water laid by her feet.</p>

        <div className='story-speech npc'>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Professor Vinca reminds you from behind the crowd as you enter further into the temple grounds.</p>

        <p>The First Temple of the Goddess is a high-rise feat of architecture, layered like clouds, pink and gold. Balconies extend from the arched windows, supported by bleached granite columns. It opens up into the air with no ceilings to keep out the rain on the rooftop, and there are no ceilings for a portion of its ground floors, where sprawling inner courtyards unfurl at its center.</p>

        <p>The Holy Temple of the Goddess appeared as untouchable as heaven. As its sister, the First Temple of the Goddess welcomes the earth's children into its embrace. Wildflowers peek out over the pathways, dotting puddles of grass with butterflies and birds and a rainbow of colors; trees with green branches curl across the sky, crying like the ocean as the wind blows through their leaves. The air is stained with flavors you can't name. The right memory slips away, as the minnows do through the streams that wind throughout the inner courtyards, glimmer-quick.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>A priest-in-training approaches you, acting as your guide for the day. He reminds you that your meeting with the vessel will last for only thirty minutes.</p>

                <p>He yawns into his mechanical fist and rolls his shoulders, "Wait. Are we gonna get to ask the lady-of-the-hour herself questions?" asking whoever. This priest guy or something.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>"Yes, as long as Lady Elysia finds the question agreeable." The priest-in-training replies.</p>

        <p>The ceremony room awaits, as patient as a lucid dream. As you approach, the image gets clearer and softer, with only the natural light from the windows to guide your way forward.</p>
        <p>Eventually, you make out the pool at the heart of the room. It sits calm and quiet, reflecting light so well that it looks white all over, blanketed in the image of snow. Nothing ripples; everything shines.</p>
        <p>Three other shadows are in the room with you. Two of them rise with smiles on their faces.</p>
        <p>Only one stands by the window, bathed all over in light like water.</p>

        <p>She locks eyes with you. Her gaze glances over you one by one, thoughtfully examining your appearance. Then, a smile graces her features.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>The vessel greets, her white skirt billowing behind her as she makes her way closer towards you. At this distance, you‚Äôre able to glean more from her appearance‚Äîgolden eyes that shine like the sun, and hair as bright as the midday sky.</p>

                <p>The Keeper stares back, expression cool. Ignore the thrumming in her chest, the beating pulse in her fingertips. Like the warmth doesn't quite reach her. It settles wrong. It <i>is</i> wrong. Why are you standing here, soaked in sunlight and breeze? Why aren't you announcing yourself to the world? Why aren't you doing what needs to be done?</p>
                <p>Haven't we waited long enough?</p>
                <p>She will not wait. Time is the one thing that cannot be controlled.</p>
                <p>Her eyes flicker to the other two figures. Checking for weapons on them.</p>
                <p>"Elysia--I am The Keeper of Novalyre. When will you alleviate the awful state Astralena has put its citizens in? Your voidpact citizens are under collar end imprisonment at this very moment, unable to live the lives that they were born to live. You <i>must</i> make statement for their freedom."</p>
            </div>

                <p className='alt-font' style={{fontSize:'16px'}}>"It's an honor to meet you, Elysia." She holds out her wrapped-up white lily almost awkwardly.</p>

An act that corrupts the user, that destroys them over time, that will inevitably result in their becoming a Voidwalker? It must remain illegal, and they must remain monitored. The law must reflect the sin and danger of their existence."</p>
                <p>She holds out the envelope in her hands. They don't shake. "In here is all the evidence I have collected over the years--from the history of Voidpacting and its ramifications, to the rise of Voidwalkers and even mutated creatures since the Void Army announced itself, and the involvement of Voidpacts in corruption--such as what happened to the last head priest, Arias."</p>

                <p>
                "Well hiii there! I'm Eris J. Caspell, all the way from lil ole Vystelle." Not that it's a small place. "What does it mean exactlyyy, vessel?

                <div className="story-speech-name">ELYSIA</div>
                <p>"Beatrix, The Keeper of Novalyre, Lucina Novena," she repeats the names fondly. "Eris J. Caspell," repeated just as warm.</p>
                <p>The white lily takes her by surprise, but her expression softens just as quickly. "Thank you for the kind gift," she says, and she keeps it in her hands as she looks back to the rest of the crowd. "And for your questions. Ah, and all your greetings, of course."</p>
                <p>"I understand your concerns well." Her smile thins, and she looks at the envelope in her hands with a conflicted expression. "However, there's some things I'd like to share with you first, so I hope you'll spare me some of your time."</p>
                <p>"Firstly, I'd like to thank you all for coming here. I'm sure it may have seemed... strange, to be invited here so suddenly, but this is not without reason."</p>
                <p>"Much like you, we from the church are very much aware of what Arias, the former head priest, has done." She pauses, "And we are also aware that many from your class have faced him directly in Hysse. For that, we'd like to give you our utmost gratitude... as well as our deepest, deepest apologies."</p>
                <p>"As for the void itself, as well as voidpacting..." Elysia pauses. She takes a step forwards, towards the pool in the middle of the room, as she ruminates.</p>
                <p>"We are aware of the new danger that it poses. However,"</p>
                <p>"It's our belief that <i>they</i> are simply victims," a tilt of her head as she faces you all again. "The Goddess herself feels much pain over the void." Said, as if she can feel it in her very bones. "And I myself have plans to curb the discrimination towards voidpacts once I am properly ordained."</p>
                <p>"Even so, the rise of voidwalkers is something that must be addressed and dealt with.</p>
                <p>"...And that, is where I enter the picture."</p>
                <p>"Are you familiar with the land of Teide?" Her lips curve upwards into a small smile. "It was a small country, sunken during the second war."</p>
                <p>"Most records say that it was decimated due to a fight over an anti-voidwalker weapon. This fact still holds true."</p>
                <p>"...What has been withheld from the public, however, is the fact that the weapon they fought for was the first vessel of Hylia."</p>
                <p>"So, as you can see, I am not the first vessel to exist in this world."</p>
                <p>"...I suppose you could say I am the second."</p>
                <p>"After being faced with the reality of mankind's greed, the main ruling powers of the countries involved opted to keep this information a secret, fearing that a fight would never end--and that war would inevitably return to this world."</p>
                <p>"With recent events in mind, the Astralenan government--after my awakening--decided to not keep it a secret from the people. This was both to bring about hope, as well as to curb the rise of voidwalkers using my own powers, once I have better control of them."</p>
                <p>"Currently, my plans to integrate voidpacts back to society involves their eventual release, starting with those who were previously professional Hunters. The government thought this to be wise, as they will also be able to assist in our efforts against the recent rise of voidwalkers."</p>
                <p>"I've also discussed for more humane treatments from them, including the removal of the shocking feature from their collars. We are currently researching on other alternatives to shut down powers without causing physical harm towards voidpacts."</p>
                <p>"...I apologize for prattling on. I'm sure you must be very confused." She bows her head in apology, as if she were just a mere girl. "If you have any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them to the best of my abilities."</p>

                <p>"A vessel relates to wielding Hylia's power as your own, or at least, a fraction of it." She smiles thinly. Elysia's attention moves back to the pool, dipping her fingertips to the water in front of her, causing ripple after ripple. "They are able to perform feats beyond what auras--and void powers--are able to manage. And,"</p>
                <p>You notice drops of water start to rise from the pool. It forms a ball of water, floating just a few centimetres off of Elysia's hand, before morphing into various shapes. A dove, a star, then finally--a lily.</p>
                <p>"They are able to do so without an aura." She lets the water dip back into the pool, causing the smallest of splashes.</p>
                <p>"And before you ask, they did check my body for marks of the void." Elysia laughs.</p>
                <p>"I do receive visions, at times. They're infrequent, but they are always true to reality." She hums, holding the lily closer against her body. "For a more recent example, I told my retainers that I would receive both a white lily and an envelope today." She gestures to the two people to the side of the room, and surely enough, there's a look of awe painted on both of their faces. "Healing is also something I am capable of. However, my powers often fluctuate, and there are days where I cannot muster my abilities at all."</p>
                <p>"My relationship with the goddess... you can say that she speaks through me, at times--but perhaps it's most accurate to say that I'm able to feel her will through my body." She straightens her posture. "Man does not have any influence on a vessel's awakening. As for whether another vessel will appear after my death... "</p>
                <p>"That, I cannot say for certain."</p>

                <p>‚ÄùYou mentioned Arias, so you must be caught up with everything he did a few months ago. Do you know anything about the society he mentioned, that he was seemingly a part of?

                <p>Eden nudges him. He doesn't step forward, but he reaches into fabric and pulls out a folded piece of printer paper. Lifts a hand in the air, waving for attention he doesn't need with a half-formed smile, marred by the reactionary wince.</p>
                <p>"Elysia," he calls. "...Would you know what these symbols are? From the Head Priest, Arias."</p>
                <p className='small'>On the paper, etchings of his pendant are perfectly redrawn. A small note, too, at the corners: Thank you! :D May the light guide your way!</p>

Many of us suspect he was controlled by another party from outside of the church's walls, and we are working our best in order to uncover the truth of the matter, as this pertains to the safety of the people."</p>
                <p>"While I myself have not received many visions in regards to this... society," she takes a long look at the piece of paper. "I have seen those symbols before, in a dream. Those are their markings."</p>

        <p>As she speaks her final word, one of the retainers chimes into the conversation. He reminds Elysia that morning prayer is starting soon, and that the students should best be on their way.</p>

My schedule will be busy in preparation for the ordainment, but please feel free to visit the temple at any time to pray with the others here."</p>
                <p>"And, of course, I'd be delighted to see you all at the ceremony itself." At this, her expression turns brighter--and a bit more girlish.</p>

                <p>This was so much information all at once. Adam‚Äôs emotions were plainly on his face as he looked at the girl speaking of great wars and wielding potential power that nations fought over. His fingers twitch as they hung to the side, as he looks to the desperate fervor of Lucina, the cool calculations of The Keeper.</p>
                <p>For a second he felt himself exhale a breath he held onto for too long, but instead it was replaced with a new aggravating worry, nagging him, cursing his mind. So you are just a girl?</p>
                <p>A girl who likes chocolate bourbon ice cream and looks barely the same age as us.</p>
                <p>The meeting is called off and Adam found himself looking back at Elysia with a bewildered look. <i>The first vessel died in an explosion that destroyed the capital.</i> What will stop the second from meeting the same fate? He had only spent a day in Solstia and without knowing a single name of theirs saw the hundreds, thousand faces that passed him by as he walked the streets with his class.</p>
                <p>Why was this meeting for us? Has she met with the hunters association yet instead? Was it just to explain the circumstances with this Arias guy that some people seem to know? Where was she from originally? Did she have parents? Siblings? She has visions? Can heal? It‚Äôs not aura but something else? Who ended up destroying Teide? Will the negotiations stay peaceful? <i>Where was her home?</i></p>
                <p>Are you ever going back?</p>
                <p>And he didn‚Äôt say any of it. Words stalled in his throat. The meeting will be concluded. And he will leave this room agonizing over the fate of someone who the entire world will know in a few scant days. And history will move its heavy hand.</p>

                <p>He's doubtful. Elysia's position puts her at stake. It's virtue of her title, which naturally wrings out a series of expectations that only clash with one another.</p>
                <p>One person will expect her to denounce everything, and show some humility despite who she inherently is. The next person will revere her for the rest of their lives, whether she turns bitter from resentment or pressurises earth into diamond. The next person wants her just for the sake of appearance. The next person yearns to make a personal connection to her. The next person hopes she loves them, or at the very least respects them. The next person pleads with her to do something, <i>anything</i>, because they need to know what is right, what is good, ordained by some higher power. The next person says me, and the next person says you.</p>
                <p>If it doesn't turn out right, let's try for a third.</p>
                <p>The Keeper is right. Disappointment. Not because he expects, reveres, wants, hopes, but because he <i>knows</i> how this goes. She can't mess up. What then? If she can't live up to her name when it's so much a part of her, then what does that make him? There's no looking away when you put your belief in a figurehead. Mistakes will become her.</p>
                <p>She's just a girl. He's worried about her. That's the inescapable truth.</p>
                <p>(He's worried. He wonders about himself. Who is he?)</p>
                <p>He can't bear to look anywhere close to her. He keeps his eyes to the floor, and reminds himself it's nonsensical to grieve when there hasn't been a death yet.</p>

                <p>"I am not allowed a personal phone, so I have no phone number, but it would be pleasant to speak to you again." Her smile turns sad, but it quickly disappears in the next moment.
